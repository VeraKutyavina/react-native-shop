- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)

## Usage
### Using scripts from console

### iOS

`yarn ios`

Like yarn start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

### Android

`yarn android`

Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup).
